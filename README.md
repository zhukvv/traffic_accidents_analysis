# Traffic Accidents Analysis
The main aim of this project is to practice and improve my hard skills, such as Python and Tableau. 

I'm going to look at the statistics of accidents to identify dangerous areas, common causes of accidents, or trends over time. I would also like to compare the statistics of two major cities in Russia: Moscow and Saint-Petersburg.
