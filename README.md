# Traffic Accidents Analysis
The main aim of this project is to practice and improve my hard skills, such as Python and Tableau. 

I'm going to look at the statistics of accidents to identify dangerous areas, common causes of accidents, or trends over time. I would also like to compare the statistics of two major cities in Russia: Moscow and Saint-Petersburg. 

So the questions are 
1) What are the most dangerous areas in the cities?
2) What are the main causes of accidents there?
3) What are the main brand of cars that get crashed?

Probably, I'll enrich this list later. 

Steps of work: 
1) get the data. The data source is a [website](http://stat.gibdd.ru/).
2) Clean the data.
3) Analyse the data.
4) Build a dashboard.
